# Distance-Monitor
This project employs an ultrasonic sensor to measure the distance to nearby objects in real time.
The Raspberry Pi continuously reads distance values and if an obstacle comes too close (for example, less than 50 cm away), it sends a warning update to a connected client.
The client application then displays the distance readings and alerts the user of potential hazards.
(Implement communication between Raspberry Pi and computer using one of the protocols UDP or TCP)
